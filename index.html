“Over 800 million people still lack access to electricity, and those with a grid-connection often suffer from an
unreliable supply” (Rapid market assessment of energy storage, 2019). Unreliable electricity is a major problem for
many low-income areas, where national grids are often poorly maintained, overloaded or affected by political and
economic instability (Avordeh et al., 2024). Outages can cut households off from lighting, communication,
refrigeration and essential medical devices, lasting from hours to even days. Therefore, these communities require
affordable, durable and maintainable alternative sources of electricity. “However, the technological and market
conditions to unlock these markets remain under-researched.” (Faraday Institution, n.d.).

</h3>

<p>
Several solutions exist to address unreliable electricity, but none fully meet the criteria of affordability,
durability and ease of maintenance (Faraday Institution, n.d.). Diesel generators are widely used where extending
the national grid is too costly, making them a practical short-term option (Flavin, 1986). They provide essential
services, but their long-term disadvantages include unstable fuel costs, frequent maintenance, high repair expenses,
pollution and noise (PowerUP Energy Technologies, 2021). Solar panels are a cleaner alternative, but installation
costs, space requirements and weather dependence can limit their effectiveness (Muzan Williams et al., 2024).
</p>

<p>
Hybrid solutions—such as solar-battery-generator systems—offer improved affordability, being “28%-36% cheaper
than diesel-only systems in countries with high generator use” (Rapid market assessment of energy storage, 2019).
Waste-to-fuel systems, especially plastic pyrolysis, also offer potential low-cost electricity if carefully managed to
avoid environmental and health risks (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). These options show the
importance of combining multiple energy sources and storage to create sustainable, reliable systems for low-income
households.

<!-- HYBRID SYSTEM DESIGN -->

</h3>

<p>
Understanding generator behaviour is crucial when designing hybrid household systems. Generators provide backup
power when solar energy is insufficient or demand is high (Prorichmotor.com, 2022). Small generators can be built
using DC motors driven by pedals or hand cranks, though efficiency must be prioritised to avoid extremely low power
output (Dincer & Rosen, 2011). Flywheels may be added to stabilise rotation and provide consistent electrical output
(Luo et al., 2015).
</p>

<p>
For generators to be viable in low-income regions, they must be low-cost, use recycled materials such as bicycle
parts or scrap metal, and avoid complex electronics that increase cost and failure rate. Local manufacturability is
key; devices that require specialised tools or parts are less accessible and harder to repair (Dincer & Rosen, 2011).
By combining local manufacturing with solar energy and storage, hybrid household systems can operate reliably even
during prolonged outages.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->

</h3>

<p>
A practical hybrid household system integrates three components: a solar-powered battery array, a small diesel or LPG
backup generator and a compact mechanical generator for emergencies (Lal & Raturi, 2012). Solar provides clean,
free daytime energy; the battery ensures a steady supply; and the backup generator activates only when necessary,
minimising fuel use (Bekele & Tadesse, 2012). Waste plastics or biomass can also be converted into fuel through
pyrolysis, creating additional local energy sources (Rahman et al., 2023).
</p>

<p>
This hybrid approach ensures reliable household electricity during outages, reduces fossil fuel dependency, lowers
costs and supports local repair and adaptability (Muzan Williams et al., 2024). Integrating solar, diesel and
mechanical generation provides sustainable, practical and resilient energy access for low-income households,
supporting essential needs such as lighting, communication, refrigeration and healthcare.
