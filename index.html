“Over 800 million people still lack access to electricity, and those with a grid-connection often suffer from an unreliable supply” (Rapid market assessment of energy storage, 2019). Unreliable electricity is a major problem for many low-income areas, where the national grids are often poorly maintained, overloaded or affected by political and economic instability (Avordeh et al., 2024). When electrical outages occur, these regions can lose access to lighting, communication, refrigeration and medical care devices. These outages can vary between hours or even days (Avordeh et al., 2024). Hence, it is vital that they have access to affordable, durable and easy to maintain alternative sources of electricity. “However, the technological and market conditions to unlock these markets remain under-researched.” (Faraday Institution, n.d.).

<p>
Several solutions exist to help tackle this problem; however, they do not meet all the criteria stated above (Faraday Institution, n.d.). For example, diesel generators are widely used because in developing regions, extending the main grid is too costly for the government, making diesel generators a practical short-term solution as they are decentralised (Flavin, 1986). They provide essential services that improve daily life, but this is a quick solution that has long-term disadvantages (Flavin, 1986). Such as high and unstable fuel costs, frequent maintenance needs, costly repairs, pollution and noisieness (PowerUP Energy Technologies, 2021). Solar panels are a cleaner alternative, but their initial costs can be high as they require careful installation and space and their performance depends heavily on weather conditions (Muzan Williams et al., 2024). “Solar-battery-genset1 hybrids are 28%-36% cheaper on a USD/kWh basis in countries with high diesel generator capacity, such as Nigeria, Kenya, and India.” (Rapid market assessment of energy storage, 2019). Another emerging option involves using waste (particularly plastic) and converting it into fuel for electricity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). This solution has a lot of potential but must be carefully managed to avoid health and environmental risks, otherwise it is an option for low-cost, safe, community-scale systems that produces a sustainable power source (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). Overall, these options highlight the need for hybrid, affordable, and small-scale systems that combine multiple energy sources and storage to produce sustainable and reliable electricity.

An important element in designing hybrid household systems is an understanding of how generators can complement renewable energy and storage. Generators transform mechanical energy into electricity, which provides a reliable source of power when solar energy is insufficient or during high-demand periods (Prorichmotor.com, 2022). DC motors can be used in generators and driven by mechanical systems such as hand cranks or pedals (Prorichmotor.com, 2022). In these designs, efficiency needs to be prioritised as it can easily lead to very low power output (Dincer & Rosen, 2011). Devices like flywheels can also be added to stabilise rotation and smoothen the motor’s motions, ensuring that the electricity delivered to batteries or appliances is consistent (Luo et al., 2015). For generators to be viable in low-income communities, they must meet specific design requirements. Cost is critical, so devices should use cheap or recycled materials, like bicycle parts, scrap metal, or salvaged motors (Dincer & Rosen, 2011). Avoiding complex electronics reduces both costs and failure risk. Generators should be manufacturable with common tools, as reliance on high-level machinery or specialised parts males them less accessible (Dincer & Rosen, 2011). Local manufacturability lowers costs and enables communities to repair or adapt systems independently (Luo et al., 2015). By combining these ideas with energy storage and solar input, hybrid systems can maintain a reliable supply for households even during prolonged outages.

</h3>

<p>
Combining these ideas, a reliable household hybrid system can be designed that involves multiple energy sources and storage to meet the needs of households while remaining affordable and maintainable (Kellogg et al., 1998). An example of such system would incorporate three parts: a solar-powered battery system, a compact diesel or LPG generator as backup, and a small mechanical generator for emergency use (Lal & Raturi, 2012). The solar part provides clean, cost-free energy during the day and charges a battery bank for night-time use (Luo et al., 2015). The battery stores energy temporarily and ensures steady supply when needed (Dunn et al., 2011). The backup diesel generator is programmed to run only when the energy in the battery is insufficient which minimises fuel consumption and operational costs while providing reliability (Bekele & Tadesse, 2012). Finally, waste plastics or biomass can be converted into liquid fuels through pyrolysis, reducing reliance on distant gas stations that may sell expensive fuel and creating an additional local energy source (Rahman et al., 2023).

<p>
This hybrid approach achieves multiple objectives: it ensures households have access to reliable energy even during prolonged grid failures, utilises renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel dependency and emissions, and it maintains affordability and maintainability and even incorporates the use of locally sourced or recycling of materials (Muzan Williams et al., 2024; Dincer & Rosen, 2011). The system’s engineering design is guided by the principles outlined above, including generator sizing, gear ratios, and mechanical durability, combined with electrical storage considerations such as battery capacity, inverter rating, and charge management. By integrating solar, diesel, and mechanical solutions into a single, compact hybrid system, households in low-income regions can achieve sustainable, reliable, and practical electricity access, supporting lighting, communication, refrigeration, and other essential needs that these low-income regions deserve.
